# Prediction of Closing Price: A Comparative Approach

This notebook contains code for predicting the closing price using five different approaches:

- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
- **Holt-Winters Model**
- **LSTM Neural Network**
- **Facebook Prophet Model**

## Steps to Run the Code
1. Please take into notice that the original csv data have been changed manually to and the all the columns leaving opening_price, closing_price and date have been shifted by one row to be considered as input for future prediction through past values.
2. Change the input file's address to match your dataset location.
3. Run all the cells in the notebook.

## Evaluation Metrics
The following evaluation metrics are used to assess the models:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It is simple and easy to interpret.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Similar to MAE but squares the errors before averaging, which penalizes larger errors more heavily.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Provides an indication of the magnitude of the residuals and emphasizes larger errors. A lower RMSE indicates better model fit.
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Measures the percentage error between predicted and actual values, useful for interpreting errors in relative terms.
- **Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)**: A variation of MAPE that symmetrically measures percentage errors, reducing bias and skewness caused by small actual values.
- **R-squared (R²)**: Represents the proportion of variance in the actual stock price that can be predicted from the model. A value closer to 1 means the model explains a large part of the variance.
- **Explained Variance Score (EVS)**: Measures the variance captured by the model, where a score of 1 indicates perfect prediction.
- **Directional Accuracy (DA)**: Evaluates how well the model predicts the direction (up or down) of stock prices, rather than the exact value.

## Flow of the Notebook
1. **Understanding the Data and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Initial analysis of the data.
   - Handling missing values and duplicates.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualization of the data with different combinations of columns to understand relationships.

3. **Understanding ACF, PACF, Seasonality, Trend, Outlier Detection, and Stationarity**:
   - A comprehensive analysis of various plots to assess the nature of the data:
     - **ACF (Autocorrelation Function)**
     - **PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function)**
     - **Seasonality and Trend**
     - **Outlier Detection**
     - **Stationarity Plots**

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Feature engineering based on domain knowledge, which is crucial for making accurate predictions.

5. **Input Preparation**:
   - Preprocessing steps and preparation of the data for input into the models.

## Model Selection
- **XGBoost & Random Forest**:  
   These models are ideal for working with tabular data, especially when the main objective is to achieve high performance and accurate results. These models set a benchmark for comparison.
  
- **LSTM Neural Networks**:  
   LSTM models are well-suited for sequential data and are used to capture temporal dependencies.

- **Holt-Winters Model**:  
   This time series model only uses value and date as input. It performs well for short-term predictions.

- **Facebook Prophet Model**:  
   A more advanced time series model that considers external factors, such as holidays, which might affect performance but are not included in other models.

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: RMSE gives an indication of how large the residuals are and emphasizes larger errors. Lower RMSE indicates better fit.

- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: MAPE measures the percentage error between the predicted and actual values, providing an understanding of error in relative terms.

- **Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)**: sMAPE is a variation of MAPE that symmetrically measures percentage errors, preventing skewness caused by small actual values. sMAPE is used when you want to normalize percentage errors and reduce bias.

- **R-squared (R²)**: R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the actual stock price that is predictable from the model. A value closer to 1 indicates that the model explains a large proportion of the variance.

- **Explained Variance Score (EVS)**: Explains the variance captured by the model, where 1 indicates perfect prediction.

- **Directional Accuracy (DA)**: DA measures how well the model predicts the direction (up or down) of stock prices rather than the exact value.
